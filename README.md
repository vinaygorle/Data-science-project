PROJECT TITLE : Predicting COVID-19 and NON-COVID-19 Deaths Trends in London Using Machine Learning
RESEARCH QUESTION : What are the most effective machine learning techniques for forecasting COVID-19 and non-covid 19 death trends across London’s areas over time?
OBJECTIVE:This study investigates the use of machine learning approaches to forecast COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 death trends across time during the COVID-19 pandemic in London's boroughs. The goal of this work is to identify trends and create predictive models by utilizing publically accessible datasets that include weekly records of COVID-19-related deaths, area names, sites of death, and other temporal characteristics. The study explicitly examines how well different machine learning methods—such as Random Forests, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)—capture temporal and geographical trends.
